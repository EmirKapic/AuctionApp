# AuctionApp
Welcome to AuctionApp! We will be making a full-stack web application that allows users to easily sell and bid on all kinds of products.

### Frontend
We will be using React with Typescript for the frontend. React allows us to easily create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces, while offering good seperation of concerns and highly reusable code.
Typescript enhances developer experience by adding types, making our codebase more stable and robust.


### Backend
We will use Java and its Spring Boot framework for the backend. Java has proven itself for enterprise-level applications making it the perfect choice for out server-side.
Using it we will be building an API to serve our frontend's needs. It will be using our PostgreSQL database for data persistance.
